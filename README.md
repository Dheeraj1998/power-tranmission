# power-transmission
This back-end has been designed to allow applications to make API calls to get the required data.

# Timeline
This project has been developed as part of SELECT Make-a-thon 2017.

# Functionalities
1. Getting summarisation of data regarding power outages.
2. Getting the data for a specific user.
3. Insertion of timings when the power turns off and is later turned back on.

# Getting started
This project has been designed to work with an Arduino unit which would make the required API calls according to the different conditions of power outages.
